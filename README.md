High-Level Walkthrough

		Online Purchase: The hobbyist gardener starts by opening the P0xLL3N app and logging in. They navigate through the DEX (decentralized exchange), filtering options based on their preferences. They select the seeds of interest and go through a secure, transparent checkout process. They have the option to pay either on-chain using ERC20 tokens or off-chain through credit card payments. Upon payment, a transaction is recorded on the BR33D3R blockchain and a confirmation email with order summary and tracking details is sent to the user.

		Receiving and Sorting: Once the seeds are received, the user inspects them. Each seed packet comes with a QR code/hash/plant tag which they scan using the app. This reveals detailed information about the strain and seed type which is recorded on the blockchain. The user then sorts and stores the seeds as per their preferences.

		Germination: The user follows the in-app guide to germinate the seeds. They log each step, along with photos, in the app, and each update is recorded on the blockchain.

		Seedling Care: The app sends notifications to the user to care for the seedlings, providing suggestions for light, temperature, water, and nutrients. The user logs their actions and observations in the app.

		Transplanting: The app guides the user through the transplanting process, reminding them of the best time to do so. The user logs the process in the app, recording the health and progress of the plants on the blockchain.

		Plant Care & Monitoring: The app continues to send notifications for plant care. It guides the user to monitor the plants for signs of their sex. Upon identification, the user updates the app, and the information is recorded on the blockchain.

		Controlled Pollination: The app guides the user on how to manually pollinate the plants, providing reminders to prevent unintentional cross-pollination. The user records the process, including the male and female plants used, in the app. This information forms a critical part of the genetic lineage recorded on the blockchain.

		Seed Collection & Harvest: The user follows the app's guidance to harvest seeds and buds at the right time. They log the process in the app, including photographs of the harvest and the condition of the plants.

		Seed Storage & Future Planting: The user records in the app how they store the seeds for future planting, including any observations or notes about the cross-pollination process. This information, critical for future reference and for creating new hybrids, is recorded on the blockchain.

Architecture

Frontend: The frontend is a mobile app developed using Next.js. It is a Progressive Web App (PWA), ensuring it works seamlessly on any device and can be sold on all app stores. It is designed to be user-friendly, easy to navigate, and visually appealing. It features the DEX and a suite of guides and tools for the user's gardening journey.

Backend: The backend is developed using Express.js, which communicates with the frontend, handles business logic, and interacts with the database and the blockchain.

Blockchain: BR33D3R is an Optimism L2 blockchain that records all transactions and plant-related updates. It works with the Chainlink technology for automation and oracles.

Database: The app uses a SQL database for structured data storage and GraphQL for efficient querying. It stores user information, transaction data, and plant-related updates that are not stored on the blockchain.
Authentication: User authentication is handled using OAuth. Multiple sign-in methods are supported to ensure ease of use.
Smart Contracts: A suite of Solidity smart contracts handle the creation and management of the DEX, payment processing, recording transactions and plant-related updates on the blockchain, and handling the seed swap functionality.
This architecture ensures scalability, user privacy, and data security while providing a seamless, enjoyable user experience. The app harnesses the power of blockchain to bring transparency and authenticity to the gardening and seed swapping process.
