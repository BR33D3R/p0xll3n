8. PlantCare: Provides notifications and guidance for plant care based on plant growth cycles and user inputs.
9. UserLog: Enables users to log actions, observations, and updates, which are then saved to the blockchain.
10. QRScanner: Decodes QR codes/hashes/plant tags of received seeds to fetch associated information.
11. SeedSwap: Facilitates the swapping of seeds between users on the DEX, managing transactions and updating seed ownership.
12. SeedCountVerification: Uses the device's video camera to visually count received seeds and confirm quantity matches the shipment details.
13. StateManagement: Manages the app's state in relation to the blockchain, ensuring consistency between the app and blockchain data.

Each .js file in the /components directory represents the individual components outlined above. The BlockchainService.js and CameraService.js files in the /services directory could handle communication with the blockchain and camera functionalities, respectively.
The /contexts directory might contain any context providers, if you're using a Context API for state management. If you're using Redux or Mobx for state management, you might have different directories/files like /stores and /actions.
You would also need various utility functions, which could be stored in a /utils directory.
The /assets directory is for storing static assets like images and global stylesheets.
Tests for each component can be stored in the /tests directory.
Remember, this is a general guide and the exact structure may change based on your specific requirements, the technologies you're using, and your personal or team's preferences.
